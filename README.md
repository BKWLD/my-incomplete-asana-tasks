# my-incomplete-asana-tasks

A self executing JS function that filters a project to the incomplete tasks assigned to you, sorted by status.

1. Bookmark an Asana project page.
2. Edit the bookmark, pasting in the contents of [script.min.js](./script.min.js).
3. Select the bookmark when you're on the project page.

I may make this a Chrome extension in the future that executes itself automatically whenever you visit specific project pages in Asana.
